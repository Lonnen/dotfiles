I had pretty lofty goals but unfortunately there's not enough time to go around, there are still many features missing, and it's not quite in a usable state, but with some community interest and love maybe it will get there some day! If not at least some useful/clean IRC libs are available at [https://github.com/slate](https://github.com/slate).\n\n Conceptually I really just wanted a clean, minimalistic IRC client, completely extensible through plugins. Ideally most of the core is written using such plugins. The entire thing should be themable, and the default theme should be programmer-friendly, aka get all the clutter out of my way, I just want to see chat logs.\n\n## Usage\n\n - press `?` to display the shortcut dialog\n\n## Building\n\n Install node, [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit) and clone the repo.\n\n Build and run with:\n\n```\n$ make\n```\n\n  Build with:\n\n```\n$ make build\n```\n\n  Continuous build with:\n\n```\n$ watch make build\n```\n\n# License\n\n  MIT\n\n","markers":{"markers":{"1":{"id":1,"range":[[0,0],[0,0]],"tailed":false,"reversed":false,"valid":true,"invalidate":"never","persistent":true,"properties":{"type":"selection","editorId":19},"deserializer":"Marker"},"8":{"id":8,"range":[[11,3],[11,11]],"tailed":true,"reversed":false,"valid":true,"invalidate":"inside","persistent":true,"properties":{"replicate":false},"deserializer":"Marker"},"9":{"id":9,"range":[[23,66],[23,77]],"tailed":true,"reversed":false,"valid":true,"invalidate":"inside","persistent":true,"properties":{"replicate":false},"deserializer":"Marker"},"10":{"id":10,"range":[[25,191],[25,199]],"tailed":true,"reversed":false,"valid":true,"invalidate":"inside","persistent":true,"properties":{"replicate":false},"deserializer":"Marker"}},"deserializer":"MarkerManager"},"history":{"undoStack":[],"redoStack":[],"deserializer":"History"},"filePath":"/Users/lonnen/repos/slate/Readme.md","modifiedWhenLastPersisted":false,"digestWhenLastPersisted":"49126166f78173803321695f6f76a8fa65d3497a","deserializer":"TextBuffer"}],"deserializer":"Project"},"workspace":{"paneContainer":{"root":{"items":[{"id":19,"softTabs":true,"scrollTop":0,"scrollLeft":0,"displayBuffer":{"id":20,"softWrap":true,"editorWidthInChars":112,"tokenizedBuffer":{"bufferPath":"/Users/lonnen/repos/slate/Readme.md","tabLength":2,"deserializer":"TokenizedBuffer"},"deserializer":"DisplayBuffer"},"deserializer":"Editor"}],"activeItemUri":"/Users/lonnen/repos/slate/Readme.md","focused":true,"active":true,"deserializer":"Pane"},"deserializer":"PaneContainer"},"fullScreen":false,"deserializer":"Workspace"},"packageStates":{"command-logger":{"eventLog":{"application:quit":{"count":1,"name":"application:quit","lastRun":1397059521572}}},"fuzzy-finder":{"/Users/lonnen/repos/slate/Readme.md":1397059517796},"keybinding-resolver":{"attached":false},"metrics":{"sessionLength":4972},"tree-view":{"directoryExpansionStates":{},"selectedPath":"/Users/lonnen/repos/slate/Readme.md","hasFocus":false,"attached":true,"scrollLeft":0,"scrollTop":0,"width":200}}}
